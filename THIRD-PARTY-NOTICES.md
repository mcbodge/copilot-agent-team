The adapted files were rewritten and changed for this project; the original copyright notices and license text are reproduced here as those licenses require. Companion tools the README points to are not included and keep their own licenses.

  - `agents/cat-tdd-red.agent.md`, `agents/cat-tdd-green.agent.md`, `agents/cat-tdd-refactor.agent.md`, and `agents/cat-tdd-cycle.agent.md`, from the TDD Red, Green, and Refactor Phase agents.
  - `agents/cat-csharp-engineer.agent.md`, `instructions/csharp.instructions.md`, and `instructions/csharp-tests.instructions.md`, from the C# Expert agent.
  - The plan infrastructure of `agents/cat-implementation-planner.agent.md`, `agents/cat-work-item-planner.agent.md`, and `agents/cat-plan-executor.agent.md` (plan files with front matter and status values, `{purpose}-{component}-{version}` file names, `REQ-`/`TASK-`-style ID prefixes, phase task tables with Completed and Date columns, and the section template), inspired by and adapted from [`agents/implementation-plan.agent.md`](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/agents/implementation-plan.agent.md) (Implementation Plan Generation Mode).

## Karpathy guidelines (andrej-karpathy-skills)

- Source: <https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills> (formerly `forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills`), derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls
- Author: forrestchang (named in the project's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; the repository has no LICENSE file or copyright line)
- License: MIT, as declared in the project's README, `skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (text below)
- Adapted in: `instructions/lean-code.instructions.md` (assumptions and questions before code, a success check before changing code, surgical edits, no handling for impossible cases) and the scope-creep check in `agents/cat-code-reviewer.agent.md`.

## Inspiration only

No text or code reused, listed for credit:

- `agents/cat-code-simplifier.agent.md` follows the idea of the code-simplifier agent in [anthropics/claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official).
- The interview protocol in `agents/cat-implementation-planner.agent.md` and `agents/cat-work-item-planner.agent.md` (one decision per question via the ask-questions tool, each with a recommended answer, and the codebase explored before the user is asked) follows the idea of Michele Ferracin's[`agents/mfse-plan-on-roids.agent.md`](https://github.com/MFSoftwareEngineering/mfse-softwarefactory/blob/main/agents/mfse-plan-on-roids.agent.md) in MFSoftwareEngineering/mfse-softwarefactory.
